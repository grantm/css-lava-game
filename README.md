This project implements a small browser-based game called "The Floor is Lava!".

The game is built using HTML and CSS, but **no Javascript**.

You can play the game [here](https://grantm.github.io/css-lava-game/).  Working out _how_ to play it is half the fun.

For an explanation of how it works, see this
[lightning talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwRqhJg_va8) recorded at
[WOSSAT](https://wossat.nz/) and follow along with
[the slides](https://wossat.nz/archive/2019-02/grant-mclean-css-game/).
